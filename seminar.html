    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">09/17 - Mohammad Ghomi (Georgia Tech)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify"><b>Title: Geometric Inequalities in Spaces of Non-Positive Curvature.</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> We will survey a number of outstanding problems and recent results in the theory of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, i.e., complete, simply connected spaces with nonpositive curvature. These are CAT(0) spaces which generalize the Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces and share many of their basic properties. For instance any pair of points may be connected by a unique geodesic, and thus notions of convexity are natural to study. Yet many basic questions concerning isoperimetric inequalities, total curvature of hypersurfaces, or even the structure of the convex hull of 3 points remain open.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">10/15 - Kobe Marshall-Stevens (Johns Hopkins)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><b>Title: Generic Regularity of Isoperimetric Regions in Dimension Eight</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> An isoperimetric region is a minimiser of boundary area for a fixed enclosed volume, with sharp regularity theory guaranteeing that its boundary is smooth away from a closed singular set of codimension seven. I will discuss both previous and upcoming work which shows that, for a generic choice of metric and enclosed volume on a closed eight-dimensional manifold, every isoperimetric region has smooth boundary.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">10/22 - Peter McGrath (NCSU)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><b>Title: Extremal Domains for the First Eigenvalue of the Laplacian.</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> The Faber-Krahn inequality asserts that the round balls uniquely minimize the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian among domains in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with the same volume. In 1970, Serrin proved more generally that balls are the only critical points for the functional assigning a domain in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to its first eigenvalue. Much less is known about the analogous problem for domains in the round \(n\)-sphere, and for \(n = 2\), Souam conjectured (2005) the only critical domains are rotationally symmetric disks and annuli. I will discuss the construction of counterexamples (joint work with C. Hines and J. Kolesar) to this conjecture.</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">11/05 - Nick Edelen (Notre Dame)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify"><b>Title: Improved Regularity for Minimizing Capillary Hypersurfaces.</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> Capillary surfaces model the geometry of liquids meeting a container at an angle, and arise naturally as (constrained) minimizers of the Gauss free energy. We give improved estimates for the size of the singular set of minimizing capillary hypersurfaces: the singular set is always of codimensions at least 4 in the surface, and this estimate improves if the capillary angle is close to \(0\), \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), or \(\pi\). For capillary angles that are close to \(0\) or \(\pi\), our analysis is based on a rigorous connection between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli problem. This is joint work with Otis Chodosh and Chao Li.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">11/12 - Arjun Sobnack (UT Austin)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify"><b>Title: Delayed structure for Curve Shortening Flows.</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> Topping & the speaker proposed, in 2024, the principle that if two disjoint embedded (and sufficiently nice) Curve Shortening Flows (CSFs) bound an evolving connected region of fixed area A, then the regularity of one should be controlled after time A/\(\delta\) by the time, the area A and the regularity of the other. A handful of concrete results in the graphical setting which fit into the framework were provided. In this talk I will discuss further work into this principle. Here we relax the grahicality constraint and ask the same question: Does the CSF regularise after a time depending on only the area? I will present a positive result in the flavour of this direction. Under a relaxed notion of 'swept area', given a (sufficiently nice) non-graphical curve, the CSF takes it to a graphical curve, with controlled geometry, after a time depending on only the swept area. Time permitting, I will explain some aspects of the proof; one of which is an 'alternative' Harnack quantity/inequality for the CSF which does not require convexity. All work is joint with P. M. Topping.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">11/19 - Alec Payne (NCSU)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify"><b>Title: A Generalized Brakke Equality and Worldlines of Mean Curvature Flow</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> Mean curvature flow (MCF) is the deformation of surfaces with velocity equal to the mean curvature vector. MCF originated in materials science and is widely used as a tool for geometric and topological problems. Major open questions about MCF include how large of singular sets can form, whether the area of the flow is continuous through singular times, and how the various weak solutions may differ. We address these questions under an assumption on the size of the set of singularities with ``slow" mean curvature growth. With this assumption, an \(n\)-dimensional flow has \(\mathcal{H}^{n}\)-measure zero singular sets at every time, has mass that is continuous through singular times, and under an additional mild condition, the level set flow fattens at the discrepancy time of the inner/outer flow. The key technical development is a generalized Brakke equality, which characterizes the deviation from equality in Brakke's inequality. This is achieved by developing a worldline analysis of Brakke flow, which allows us to relate the regular parts of the flow at different times and estimate the transport of mass into and out of the singular set.</p>
