    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">09/17 - Mohammad Ghomi (Georgia Tech)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify"><b>Title: Geometric Inequalities in Spaces of Non-Positive Curvature.</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> We will survey a number of outstanding problems and recent results in the theory of Cartan-Hadamard manifolds, i.e., complete, simply connected spaces with nonpositive curvature. These are CAT(0) spaces which generalize the Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces and share many of their basic properties. For instance any pair of points may be connected by a unique geodesic, and thus notions of convexity are natural to study. Yet many basic questions concerning isoperimetric inequalities, total curvature of hypersurfaces, or even the structure of the convex hull of 3 points remain open.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">10/15 - Kobe Marshall-Stevens (Johns Hopkins)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><b>Title: Generic Regularity of Isoperimetric Regions in Dimension Eight</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> An isoperimetric region is a minimiser of boundary area for a fixed enclosed volume, with sharp regularity theory guaranteeing that its boundary is smooth away from a closed singular set of codimension seven. I will discuss both previous and upcoming work which shows that, for a generic choice of metric and enclosed volume on a closed eight-dimensional manifold, every isoperimetric region has smooth boundary.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">10/22 - Peter McGrath (NCSU)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;"><b>Title: Extremal Domains for the First Eigenvalue of the Laplacian.</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> The Faber-Krahn inequality asserts that the round balls uniquely minimize the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian among domains in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with the same volume. In 1970, Serrin proved more generally that balls are the only critical points for the functional assigning a domain in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to its first eigenvalue. Much less is known about the analogous problem for domains in the round \(n\)-sphere, and for \(n = 2\), Souam conjectured (2005) the only critical domains are rotationally symmetric disks and annuli. I will discuss the construction of counterexamples (joint work with C. Hines and J. Kolesar) to this conjecture.</p>
    
    <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-size: 25px;">11/05 - Nick Edelen (Notre Dame)</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: justify"><b>Title: Improved Regularity for Minimizing Capillary Hypersurfaces.</b><br> <b>Abstract:</b> Capillary surfaces model the geometry of liquids meeting a container at an angle, and arise naturally as (constrained) minimizers of the Gauss free energy. We give improved estimates for the size of the singular set of minimizing capillary hypersurfaces: the singular set is always of codimensions at least 4 in the surface, and this estimate improves if the capillary angle is close to \(0\), \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), or \(\pi\). For capillary angles that are close to \(0\) or \(\pi\), our analysis is based on a rigorous connection between the capillary problem and the one-phase Bernoulli problem. This is joint work with Otis Chodosh and Chao Li.</p>
